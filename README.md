# Equipment Reliability & Failure Analytics Dashboard

A premium Python-based analytics tool to calculate industrial failure rates, MTTR (Mean Time to Repair), and MTTF (Mean Time to Failure) using Excel data.

## 🚀 Features
- **Excel Upload:** Process industrial failure logs directly.
- **Formulas Integrated:** 
  - Operating Time = Observation Period - Downtime.
  - Failure Rate (λ) = 1 / MTTF.
  - Repair Rate (μ) = 1 / MTTR.
- **Dynamic Visuals:** Bar charts for time distribution and Pie charts for failure reasons.
- **Unit Toggle:** View results in Minutes or Hours.

## 🛠️ One-Click Setup (Recommended)

To make it even easier, I've created setup scripts:

### For Windows Users:
1. Double-click the file named **`setup_and_run.bat`**.
2. It will automatically check for Python, install all libraries, and launch the dashboard.

### For Mac/Linux Users:
1. Open terminal in this folder.
2. Run: `chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh`

## 🛠️ Manual Setup Guide (If scripts fail)

## 📂 File Explanations
- `app.py`: The main application code (Streamlit).
- `generate_test_data.py`: A helper script to create a sample Excel file for testing.
- `failure_data_new.xlsx`: The sample data file (generated by the helper script).

## 📊 Expected Data Format
Your Excel file should ideally have these columns:
1. **Equipment Downtime (Minutes)**: Numeric values for breakdown duration.
2. **Reason**: (Optional) Text describing the cause of failure.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Error: 'streamlit' is not recognized:** Use `python -m streamlit run app.py` instead of just `streamlit run`.
- **Data Loading Error:** Ensure your Excel columns are selected correctly from the dropdowns in the sidebar.
